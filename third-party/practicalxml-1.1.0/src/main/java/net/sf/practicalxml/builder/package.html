	<code>XmlBuilder</code> is a tool for declarative construction of XML.
	It was originally created to generate XML for unit tests, but is useful
	wherever you want to construct XML documents with minimal code and a
	low memory footprint.
	<p>
	The two classes of interest are {@link net.sf.practicalxml.builder.ElementNode}
	and {@link net.sf.practicalxml.builder.XmlBuilder}: the former contains public
	methods for transforming a tree into various representations, while the latter
	contains static methods for building such a tree:
		
	<pre>
		import static net.sf.practicalxml.builder.XmlBuilder.*;
		
		// ...
		
		ElementNode root =
		    element("root",
				element("child1",
		            text("this is some &lt;text&gt;")),
		        element("child2",
		        	attribute("foo", "bar"),
		            attribute("baz", "biff")),
		        element("http::www.example.com/foo", "ns:child3"));
		
		Document dom = root.toDOM();
		String out = root.toString();
	</pre>
