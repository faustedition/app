    This package contains classes to convert between XML and a variety of
    other formats. Each conversion has a top-level convenience class in
    this package, which handles common conversion scenarios and provides
    overall documentation on the conversion. Sub-packages contain the
    actual conversion classes; you may need to use those classes directly
    for "unusual" conversions.
    <p>
    Any problems during conversion (in either direction) are reported via
    {@link ConversionException}, which is a runtime exception and will 
    wrap any actual exception. If appropriate, this exception will also
    contain the XPath to the node failing conversion.
