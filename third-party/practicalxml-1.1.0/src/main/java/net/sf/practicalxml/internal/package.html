    This package contains classes used internally by the PracticalXML library.
    Applications should not rely on the API of these classes, or indeed of their
    continued existence. In most cases, there's a better alternative in a third-
    party library.
    <p>
    A note on naming: externally-facing utility classes end with "Util", while
    internal classes end with "Utils" (note the "s"). Examples: <code>DomUtil</code>
    is meant for external use, while <code>StringUtils</code> is internal.
